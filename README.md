# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to scrape text data and images from several websites to compile information on Mars in order to create an HTML Web application using Flask, Python, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. The first step was to use Python to scrape the data from the chosen websites. The data was then stored in a database using MongoDB. Then we needed to create a web application using Flask. The Flask web application was based off of an HTML template that we created using Bootstrap formatting. After the initial web application was complete, I was able to go back and format the HTML file and addtional formatting to include a background image to the Mission to Mars title, change the color of the Scrape New Data Button, and change the layout of the Mars Hemisphere images, as well as accomodate the application to both desktoop and mobile devices.
